## 🛠️ Interaction Tips

1. **Be Direct**: The agent is programmed to be an "Executive Assistant." It favors speed and high-signal data over conversational filler.
2. **Always-A2UI Philosophy**: Almost every request—from "what time is it" to "summarize your career"—is designed to trigger a high-fidelity visual card.
3. **Contextual Intent**: The agent uses LLM-based intent detection. You don't need to use exact keywords; it understands natural requests like *"How have you been recognized?"* or *"What is the market doing?"*
4. **Interactive Components**: Most cards are interactive. Testimonials and Flashcards can be flipped/scrolled, Video cards can be played directly, and the Radar chart is dynamic.
5. **Data Driven**: All content is pulled directly from `portfolio-data.json`, ensuring consistency between the chat narrative and the visual components.
