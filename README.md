## 🎯 The Vision
Modern portfolios should be as dynamic as the careers they represent. This "Portfolio Agent" is designed to:
- **Tailor the Narrative**: Dynamically synthesize Enrique's 15+ years of experience (Google, AWS, Disney) based on the user's specific interests.
- **Render Intent**: Use the **A2UI Protocol** to automatically generate high-fidelity UI components (Timelines, Trophies, Quizzes) that match the conversational context.
- **Establish Presence**: Provide a premium, "Gemini-inspired" experience that feels like chatting with an executive assistant.
- **Always-A2UI Intelligence**: Almost every query—from cloudcerts to local weather—triggers a sleek visual dashboard instead of just text.

## ✨ The "Gems" (Interactive Capabilities)
The agent features specialized modules (or "Gems") that provide deep-dives into Enrique's history and real-time utility context:

- **📜 Career Historian**: A sequential journey through high-scale engineering and strategy.
- **🎯 Skill Matcher**: Instant analysis of how Enrique's expertise applies to specific roles or problems.
- **📊 Fit Analyzer**: A data-driven comparison of career highlights against enterprise requirements.
- **🌦️ Weather Intel**: Real-time atmospheric conditions (specifically Emerald City vibes 🌧️).
- **📈 Market Flash**: Live-look market data for Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Nasdaq 📊.
- **🕒 Temporal Context**: Precision-synced local time and Gregorian calendar data ⌚.
